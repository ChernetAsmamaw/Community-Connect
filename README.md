## 1. Project Overview

**Project Title:** Community Connect  
**Description:** Community Connect is a platform designed to bridge the gap between local businesses, artisans, and consumers within a community. It allows users to explore local services, book appointments, and engage with service providers via real-time chat. The platform is designed to facilitate seamless interaction by enabling direct communication and efficient service discovery.

This multi-tenant platform supports multiple user types, such as businesses, artisans, and consumers, each with personalized dashboards, real-time interactions, and secure transactions. The project is built with a modern tech stack, utilizing React and Redux on the frontend and a recommended backend of Node.js and MongoDB.

## 2. Core Features

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Secure login and registration for different user roles (businesses, artisans, consumers).
   - Password encryption using bcrypt, with JWT-based token authentication for secure API requests.
   - Role-based access control to restrict features according to user type.

2. **Profile Management:**
   - Comprehensive profile management, allowing businesses and artisans to showcase their services, pricing, availability, and portfolio.
   - Consumers can manage their profile, track their booking history, and interact with service providers.

3. **Search and Discovery:**
   - Advanced search filters allowing users to find services based on category, proximity (using geolocation), and availability.
   - Integration with Google Maps API for location-based search, showing nearby businesses or artisans.

4. **Booking System:**
   - A calendar-based booking system where consumers can check the availability of service providers and schedule appointments.
   - Providers can accept, decline, or modify bookings, with automatic notifications sent to both parties.

5. **Real-time Chat:**
   - Instant communication between consumers and service providers through a real-time chat feature.
   - Socket.IO is used for real-time messaging, with push notifications for unread messages.

6. **Ratings and Reviews:**
   - After each service, consumers can leave ratings and written reviews for service providers.
   - Providers can view their average rating and respond to customer feedback.

7. **Notifications System:**
   - Real-time notifications for new bookings, chat messages, and reviews.
   - Email notifications for important updates (e.g., booking confirmations).

## 3. Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **React (TypeScript):** Used for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **Redux:** Global state management to handle data like user sessions, bookings, and chat conversations across different components.
- **Styled-Components:** CSS-in-JS solution to create reusable, maintainable styles for components.
- **Testing:** Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests, ensuring reliability and preventing regressions.

### Backend
- **Node.js (Express):** Used for building a robust and scalable REST API.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for storing user profiles, services, bookings, and messages.
- **Socket.IO:** Real-time bi-directional communication between consumers and providers for chat functionality.
- **JWT Authentication:** Secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), protecting API routes with role-based access control.
- **API Endpoints:** RESTful API structure handling user authentication, booking, search, and chat-related operations.

## 4. Agile Development Process

The development of Community Connect follows an Agile methodology, ensuring continuous feedback, adaptation, and improvement. Below is an outline of the Agile practices followed:

1. **Sprints:** The project is divided into six weekly sprints. Each sprint focuses on delivering specific features, reviewed at the end of each cycle.
   - Sprint 1: Initial setup, user authentication, and basic UI for registration and login.
   - Sprint 2: Profile management and search functionality.
   - Sprint 3: Booking system integration and calendar setup.
   - Sprint 4: Real-time chat implementation.
   - Sprint 5: Reviews and notifications.
   - Sprint 6: Testing, bug fixes, and final refinements.

2. **Scrum Meetings:** Weekly Scrum meetings are held to assess progress, address blockers, and plan for the upcoming sprint.

3. **Project Management Tools:**
   - **Jira or Trello:** Task management, sprint planning, and backlog organization.
   - **GitHub:** Version control for tracking development progress.

## 5. Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js version 16 or higher installed.
- **MongoDB**: You need a running MongoDB instance (either local or using MongoDB Atlas).
- **NPM or Yarn**: Install Node.js dependencies using npm or yarn.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/community-connect.git
   cd community-connect ```
2. **Install Dependencies (Frontend and Backend):**
   Navigate to the frontend/ and backend/ directories separately and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables:**
   
   Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following environment variables:
   ```bash
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/community-connect
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   CHAT_SERVER=http://localhost:5000
   ```
4. **Running the Application:**
   
   Frontend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Backend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. **Accessing the Application:**
   ```bash
   Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   Backend API: http://localhost:5000/api
   ```
## 6. Deployment
Frontend
Deploy the React frontend using a service like Netlify or Vercel.

Backend
Host the Node.js backend on Heroku or DigitalOcean. Ensure MongoDB is properly connected using a cloud-based solution like MongoDB Atlas.

## 7. Testing
Testing is a crucial aspect of the project to ensure reliability and a bug-free experience. Both the frontend and backend will have dedicated tests for key functionality.

Frontend Testing
   - Unit Tests: Written using Jest to ensure individual components function correctly.
   - Integration Tests: Using React Testing Library to simulate user flows, such as login, profile updates, and service booking.
Backend Testing
   - Unit Tests: Testing individual API routes and business logic using Mocha and Chai.
   - Integration Tests: End-to-end tests covering user authentication, booking flow, and chat interactions.
Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following command in the respective directories:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```
## 8. Final Deliverables
